<h2>About</h2>
This project uses the PokeAPI. Pokémon data and images are extracted from <a href="https://pokeapi.co/">https://pokeapi.co/</a>

This project is constructed with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, incorporating JS Promises. It serves as a supplement to enhance my understanding of working with data structures in JS and JS events.

In the first section of the website. Users can navigate through the listed Pokémons on the website using the next and previous buttons. The Pokémons are grouped into their base and evolutions. Hovering over a Pokémon card triggers a 180-degree flip, displaying the Pokémon information. Additionally, users can press the F key to flip all currently displayed Pokémon cards and reveal their information.

In the next section, users have the option to search for Pokémon. A user input field allows them to type the Pokémon name, with a dynamically updating list of Pokémon names displayed as the user types. Rounded images beneath the Evolution label are clickable, providing users with the option to click and view detailed information about the selected Pokémon.

<h2>Additional future task</h2>
<ul>
<li>I’m considering implementing a local server to persist data, enhancing the project’s ability to store information locally. So, I could allow the client to favorites their top 5 Pokémons</li>
<li>Implementing drag/swipe which allows the client to intuitively drag/swipe Pokémon cards while browsing, also allowing the dragged card to place in Pokémon search instead of typing.</li>
<li>Introducing an input box for displaying groups of Pokémon allowing the client to view Pokémon groups without the need to browse through them individually.</li>
